Specially their fried rice. I really dislike mushy types of fried rice, but Pekin Express's wasn't! \n\nI really like their  garlic string beans, and sauted spinach! The best of all is that they are offering a special opening deal.  3 items for $5 ! \n\nLike all Chinese food, food is a bit greasy, but thats part of its yumminess ^^ Thy have over 15 dishes you can choose from. Ranging from grilled chicken, lemon chicken, mapo tofu, veggies, beef etc, 3 types of fried rice ( veggie, pork, chicken)  and 2 types of chow mein( veggie, chicken) !\n\nThis place has lots of options for vegetarians !!\n\nCheap, fast, convenient and tasty chinese food all in one place.\n\nThe place is HUGE, so you can come with a bunch of friends! \n\nService is also really friendly, and THEY ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS :) So if you never have cash handy ( like me ), and your bank is NOT bofa, then this is the place to go for a quick bite!", "stars": 4, "user_id": "90wm_01FAIqhcgV_mPON9Q", "date": "2012-09-22"}

Otherwise everything's inflated. Yeah that sandwich is $7.00. Protip: go outside, turn right into lower sproul and go to the Coffee Spot and get a sandwich for $3.75. The prepared sandwiches at GBC are all the same, and still stingier than the Coffee Spot. The hot food is greasy and unsatisfying. Odwalla is still $4.00. Then again Odwalla was never cheap.

Owner is always nice, order comes out pretty fast, lots of selection. I always go for the spicy tofu soup because I like soup, and I like spicy. You can tell them whether you want it mild, spicy, or extra spicy.\nFew drawbacks: some koreans say they can taste excessive seasoning (which isn't healthy.. forgot what they're called) and they avoid this place. As for me, I guess I've went too much to notice. Also, they only take CASH if your order isn't over like $10 or something. So make sure to take cash with you!", "stars": 3, "user_id": "90wm_01FAIqhcgV_mPON9Q", "date": "2011-12-01"}
